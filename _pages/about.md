__ABOUT ME__

Hello, my name is Brandon Frye. I am currently a student at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Engineering.
Ever since I can recall, I've had a passion for science and innovation, which has led me to where I am today.

I like to be hands on in my work, so my primary interests are in robotics, CAD, and computer hardware. Outside of that I enjoy building
things and coming up with new ideas for projects of varying types. I have worked hard to get where I am today, and I look
forward to where that takes me in the future.
