__EDUCATION:__

I graduated from Tecumseh High School in 2020 with academic honors, having achieved a 4.0 GPA and having taken multiple AP classes
to prepare myself for college such as Calculus.

I graduated from Michigan State University in 2025 with a bachlors of science in Computer Engineering, with a concentration in robotics and automation.

__EXPERIENCE:__

I spent my four years in high school as a part of the FIRST Robotics team, where I would collaborate with a group of peers to design
a robot that was able to meet certain requirements as set forth by FIRST. We worked collaboratively to design, build, and program the robot and I was an integral
part of all of these processes. I spent three years on the Tecumseh High School team, but for my fourth year I worked with a technical institution that I was taking courses at. Taking part in this taught me valuable skills like teamwork, planning, design, and how to carry out a design to completion.

Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my life has been my earning of the rank of Eagle Scout for the Boy Scouts of America organization.
This is a prestigious title that showcases I have met the many rigourous requirements and learned the necessary skills throughout my time in the organization.
The culmination of this is the Eagle Scout project, where the candidate must undertake a community service project, directing, organizing, and carrying it out.
For my project, I assisted MSU Hidden Lake Gardens in Onstead, Michigan. They requested me to build a library box for them to offload some of their excess books.
Using the resources that were provided of me, I planned out the project and brought a team together to implement it.

In my final year at Michigan State University, my capstone project was to work with a group of five individuals on a project sponsored by a company.
Our project was for Henry Ford Health and they wanted us to build an autonomous robot that would be capable of carrying samples between their multiple labs.
The robot had to be designed with a robust, clean frame that could withstand any potential collisions and would also be easy to disenfect in the event of a spill.
We also developed a UI through a website that allows the employees to indicate which lab the robot should move to. It also has an embedded camera so that any
operators can see where the robot is at any given time. The core of the robot was a small test kit that would sit inside the frame. This kit contained a
board that would be able to save commands as well as LIDAR and a depth camera for obstacle avoidance.
