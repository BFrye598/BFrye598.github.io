EDUCATION:

I graduated from Tecumseh High School in 2020 with academic honors, having achieved a 4.0 GPA and having taken multiple AP classes
to prepare myself for college such as Calculus.

I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University with a major in Computer Engineering, working for a concentration in robotics and automation.
My expected graduation date is May 2025.

EXPERIENCE:

I spent my four years in high school as a part of the FIRST Robotics team, where I would collaborate with a group of peers to design
a robot that was able to meet certain requirements as set forth by FIRST. We worked collaboratively to design, build, and program the robot and I was an integral
part of all of these processes. I spent three years on the Tecumseh High School team, but for my fourth year I worked with a technical institution that I was taking courses at. Taking part in this taught me valuable skills like teamwork, planning, design, and how to carry out a design to completion.
