__EDUCATION:__

I graduated from Tecumseh High School in 2020 with academic honors, having achieved a 4.0 GPA and having taken multiple AP classes
to prepare myself for college such as Calculus.

I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University with a major in Computer Engineering, working for a concentration in robotics and automation.
My expected graduation date is May 2025.

__EXPERIENCE:__

I spent my four years in high school as a part of the FIRST Robotics team, where I would collaborate with a group of peers to design
a robot that was able to meet certain requirements as set forth by FIRST. We worked collaboratively to design, build, and program the robot and I was an integral
part of all of these processes. I spent three years on the Tecumseh High School team, but for my fourth year I worked with a technical institution that I was taking courses at. Taking part in this taught me valuable skills like teamwork, planning, design, and how to carry out a design to completion.

Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my life has been my earning of the rank of Eagle Scout for the Boy Scouts of America organization.
This is a prestigious title that showcases I have met the many rigourous requirements and learned the necessary skills throughout my time in the organization.
The culmination of this is the Eagle Scout project, where the candidate must undertake a community service project, directing, organizing, and carrying it out.
For my project, I assisted Hidden Lake Gardens in Michigan with a project. They requested of me to build a library box for them to offload some of their books
that they had an excess of, so using what they gave me, I planned out the project and brought a team together to implement it.
